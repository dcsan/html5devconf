# meteor-boilerplate

This boilerplate is here to give you a starting point for your meteor projects, with a console tool to ease up some tasks. Here's what you get with it.

* meteor-boilerplate console tool, for scaffolding files and more
* Essential atmosphere packages included, like [Iron Router](https://github.com/EventedMind/iron-router) and [Velocity](https://github.com/xolvio/velocity)
* Profile support for ES6 and Coffeescript

The boilerplate looks like following: [boilerplate.meteor.com](http://boilerplate.meteor.com). Have a look at [starthacking](http://starthacking.meteor.com/) for a project created with this boilerplate.

## How to install

First, [download](https://github.com/matteodem/meteor-boilerplate/zipball/master) and unpack the boilerplate archive.
```sh
# Assuming meteor is already installed
cd /path/to/project/
meteor
```

## How to use
```sh
node meteor-boilerplate # Lists all possible commands
node meteor-boilerplate create:module # Interactive console for command
node meteor-boilerplate create:module loginBox # Executes it immediately
```

### Removing default code

There's already a lot of predefined code in this boilerplate, to show you the possible functionality. However, if you want to start off with an
empty project, use the provided command to get rid off all the code you don't need.

```sh
node meteor-boilerplate reset:project
```

### Available profiles

* coffee (coffeescript, Unfancy JavaScript)
* es6 (traceur, Traceur is a JavaScript.next-to-JavaScript-of-today compiler)

You can change your profile like that
```sh
node meteor-boilerplate change:profile coffee
```

Also use the ```reset:project``` command to start off with blank files according to your profile.

### Deployments

Support for [Meteor Up](https://github.com/arunoda/meteor-up) is integrated, use following commands to set up your deployment process.

```sh
node meteor-boilerplate mup:init # walks you through the setup process
node meteor-boilerplate mup:deploy # deploys to server
```

### Packages used

* standard-app-packages
* less
* jquery
* underscore
* handlebar-helpers
* iron-router
* accounts-password
* accounts-ui
* iron-router-progress
* semantic-ui
* collection2
* velocity-html-reporter

The "insecure" and "autopublish" packages are removed by default (they make your app vulnerable).
